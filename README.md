# Wizards Guide

The Runiverse is filled with stories old as time itself surrounding its denizens.
Where would history be without the Book of Lore to catalog the stores? 
How would we know the wizards and witches throughout history? 

The Ancient Chronomancer Marius of the Garden attempts to catalog and preserve the history of these great beings.
*Even if some of them now resemble delicious pasteries today...*

The Chronomancer's Riviera is home to an ancient library hidden in time - a boundless repository of knowledge lost to the ages.
Only those who posses the power to bend time may seek to enter.
**For all others, there's the Wizards Guide**.
