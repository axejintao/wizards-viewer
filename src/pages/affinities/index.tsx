              affinities have no names - they are only referred to by a numeric \
              id. All components of a wizard (body, familiar, etc.) are associated \
              with one or many affinities. The combination of these affinities \
              make up a wizard's overall affinity. Any given wizard's maximum \
              affinity would be the number of traits they have."

            community, we should name these affinities to have common
            terminology to discuss them.
